# Log Processing Agent.

## AWS Services are:

1. AWS S3 
2. AWS Lambda
3. AWS Cloudwatch

In this exercise we will learn about how to create a lambda function, how to integrate lambda function and s3 event trigger and to view the logs in cloudwatch. 

The project source includes function code and supporting resources:
- `src/main` - A Java function.
- `src/test` - A unit test and helper classes.
- `template.yml` - An AWS CloudFormation template that creates an application.
- `build.gradle` - A Gradle build file.
- `pom.xml` - A Maven build file.

# Requirements
- [Java 8 runtime environment (SE JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Gradle 5](https://gradle.org/releases/) or [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html)
- The Bash shell. For Linux and macOS, this is included by default. In Windows 10, you can install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Windows-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash.
- [The AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) v1.17 or newer.
